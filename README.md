# BLE-Programing-Testing-board-rev1
Due to the weird packaging of the Bluetooth devices, programming/testing them before being soldered is nearly impossible. This board will take advantage of some "Flex pins" and it will be able to program and test the following devices: RN4870/RN4871/RN4678.

Download the repo and open BLE BOARD.PrjPcb using Altium Designer preferably.
